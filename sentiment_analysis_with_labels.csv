My belt bag started ripping at the corner seam within 3 months of having it. After contacting customer service they said it was over a year old and they couldn’t do anything for me. I explained the bag was only 3 months old and attached photos as well as my receipt showing the date of purchase and they told me they could no longer assist me and the case was closed.

"At the store in Bend, OR, the sales assistant ordered a pair of pants in my size which were not available in the store.  This was on June 3.  On June 6, I received an email stating that the item had shipped. On June 7, my credit card was charged for the item.  On June 10, I tracked my shipment only to learn that the shipper was still awaiting the item.  I contacted Lululemon through the live chat which was completely useless.  I then called and, after waiting on hold for a long time, was immediately told that ""the item was lost"" and that I could get it shipped in another color or get a refund.  If the system immediately knew that the item was lost, why was it necessary for me to do all the work to track this down.  I should have been sent an email right away giving me the option to cancel the order.  As it stands, I now have to wait another 10 business days to get a refund.

"Bought All the Right Places High-Rise Drawcord Waist Crop 23” tights and recieved them Jan 6, 2024, I work away for a month at a time so they effectively had 2 months of wear, maybe once per week.  Approximatley a total of 8 wears and the seem in the crotch ripped.  I used their customer service to submit an issue and was told that I had caused accidental damage.  Just wondering how one causes accidental damage to the crotch area? lol The seem definitely parted quickly upon receiving the goods and caused a two inch hold in the crotch.  Lulu customer care basically told me to go fly a kite and effectively does not stand behind their products.  This after a year before I ordered and received a pair just before Christmas and upon first wear the leg had a tear in it, I reached out to them at that time they basically said we're too busy with our Christmas sales rush to help you.  So basically they think they are too big to fail and don't actually stand behind the quality of their products any longer.  I had a pair of lulu's in the 2000's that lasted 7 years, now 8 wears for a 128$ pair or pants? No thank you, never again Lulu.

"2 stars only for the representatives that tried to help in the situation.I received a gift card for my birthday from a friend for $50. I went to use it in store, and was told by the cashier that the magnetic strip didn’t work, and I would have to call customer service to get help. I tried to upload the card on the app, but the pin was unreadable on the card. I left and called to figure out my options. I was told the card had a pre-authorization fee that had to be waived (which would take 2 weeks) and then the funds would be moved to a different e-gift card that I could use. I called back 3 times within the span of 3 weeks, and I kept being told the same thing, to wait until the fee was waived and then it would be transferred. Finally when I called, I was told the card had been compromised and been used, and there was nothing they could do about it. Which means my friend was scammed out of $50 by lululemon.This gift card was never used outside of the time I tried to use it in store and was told the magnetic strip doesn’t work. The only way it could have been compromised is before it was purchased, which means lululemon sold a compromised gift card, or the lululemon store at which is was used somehow took the information for it and compromised it. I asked to speak to the resolutions team on the phone, or some kind of manager or supervisor, and was told they don’t allow customers to speak on the phone with either party. The resolutions team then “resolved” the issue by sending me an email telling me to contact my local police.

Jacket was well packaged in an environmentally friendly cardboard box, sealed with paper tape - easy to recycle.Jacket performs really well, warm but not overly heavy. Good sized pockets for gloves, phone and bits and bobs. Jacket performs really well in the rain. Inner lining to wrists and neck keeps out the elements and cold.

"Would like to feedback on Lululemon Auz Live chat customer service rude behaviour. Beside the fact they are unable to resolve my issue, they are also lack of empathy. Instead of not giving decent suggestion, i was ended my chat rudely by the customer support: Erin. Please send her for some proper customer support training, her character is ultimately lack of empathy and customer experience with her is extremely negative. I wonder how Lululemon set their criteria during their hiring process. If there is no solution, i would at least hope to be given more directive or understanding reply.Feedbacking on the multiple time of price glitch and purchase issue, all they could do is unable to honour. Please work into your customer support training and system price glitch. I believe the price point set by Lululemon should justify the amount of after sales service i should be getting.

"I will no longer purchase from this company. The quality of their athletic clothes is truly not up to par and it’s really just the brand name that keeps them afloat. Their customer service is even worse than their overpriced athletic wear. I was returning a bottom with a weirdly turned seam and after it was said and done I kept receiving all these emails from the company regarding resolving the issue of the return. There was no issue and no matter how many times I responded with “it’s all done, my return is refunded,” the emails kept coming constantly!! Finally I wrote “STOP!!!” This got the attention of ONE of the customer service reps and she apologized for the massive numberof unnecessary emails, and then offered to send a $30 ecard for my trouble. I thought this very “Nordstrom-like” and thanked them. I never received the gift card. I wrote to them and they said they sent it. The ONE email from them that didn’t actually arrive in my e-box??

They would have to investigate, which would take 6 business days. That would be too long, since my family is leaving the country before that time period and gone for 3 months.

"I recently had the misfortune of dealing with Lululemon's customer service, and it was a complete disappointment. For a brand that prides itself on quality and excellence, their customer service fell far short of expectations.I simply wanted to modify the size of an order I had placed a 1.20hr ago, but the representatives I spoke with seemed utterly incompetent. Despite explaining my situation clearly, they offered no viable solutions and seemed unaware of basic customer service protocols. As someone who works in customer care myself, I was shocked by their lack of knowledge and willingness to help.What's even more frustrating is that the issue was entirely their fault to begin with. Due to their system limitations, I was unable to make the modification directly, yet they refused to take responsibility for their own shortcomings.Overall, my experience with Lululemon's customer service was nothing short of a nightmare. It's truly disheartening to see such a renowned brand fail so miserably in an aspect that is crucial for customer satisfaction.

Lululemon has made significant changes to their policies over the last year. During this transition the lululemon would allow a customer to use a gift card with a sweat collective discount. Whenever a sale item is returned its refunded to a gift card. These returns add up so my gift card size was around 300 USD. While checking out my discount and gift cards were accepted and I was shown the correct total. Reviewing my bank statement lululemon charged me a completely different amount and removed my gift cards from the order. A representative on chat admitted to their new policy change as well as the gift cards removal. I felt very uncomfortable with this type of corporate behavior. I’ve been a loyal customer for years.

"“The online service is absolutely horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible."" - Lululemon Store Leader, Columbus Ohio…one of Lululemon’s own store leaders said it best!As a long-time admirer of lululemon, it pains me to say that my recent experiences have tarnished my perception of the brand. What was once perceived as a symbol of excellence in quality and customer service now appears to be a facade deteriorating due to disregard and disinterest.Quality issues have become alarmingly prevalent, with representatives admitting to a backlog in addressing customer concerns under their Quality Promise. Waiting up to 15 business days, or perhaps more, for a response hardly reflects a commitment to customer satisfaction. It's disheartening to learn that their quality queue is inundated with cases.Equally disappointing is the apparent reluctance of senior leaders to engage with customer feedback (i.e., respond via phone call, as requested). Despite attempts to communicate concerns, it seems that some voices are actively suppressed. Being apparently blocked via email by senior leaders like Sun Choe, Chief Product Officer, and Nikki Neuburger, Chief Brand Officer, speaks volumes about their receptiveness to constructive feedback and their dedication to customer service.Even attempting to escalate matters through traditional channels proves pointless, as contacting a supervisor or manager via customer service yields the dismissive response, ""we don't do transfers."" Such a stance only reinforces the impression that customer satisfaction is low on their list of priorities.In light of these revelations, I urge others to come forward and share their experiences and feedback, despite Lululemon's apparent attempts to shut out valuable voices.","{'neg': 0.113, 'neu': 0.771, 'pos': 0.116, 'compound': -0.4442}",-0.4442,Negative

"I was an avid shopper of Lululemon.  An item I really liked was the STILL PANT.  I work in healthcare and they were of good quality.  This was 5 years ago or so.  Recently, I decided to replenish some items and went to the store to purchase.  Much to my dismay, I was appalled at the quality of the clothes.  I was told they have changed to a new material, Nuprene, I think it’s called.  Has this company grown so much that the quality and design has taken a downward spiral?  I did not buy anything and walked out.  I will not shop here again.  I’m sad that greed and production has taken over.  Now I search for another line that will provide quality over quantity.  It’s like companies like Adidas, Nike, etc.  once they’ve established a persona you now are paying for a logo, not actually quality merchandise.  Lululemon is now a dime a dozen garbage.

"I reached out to their customer service since several packages in a row were delivered late, one being a birthday gift and one that was supposed to be delivered before I left town. Since it wasn't delivered before I left, I would've missed the return date if it didn’t fit. I was informed that although every online order I've made gives an ""arrives by"" date, that date is actually an estimated delivery date and not a guarantee. The response to my frustration was that shipping is 2-6 business days and they'd pass along my frustrations. Of course, since those emails several weeks ago, it still says ""arrives by"" when ordering. I think the website is incredibly misleading and the customer service was useless and bordering on rude. If the shipping is 2-6 business days, there should be a range of delivery dates with the ""arrives by"" date being the latest of the range. For such expensive clothing, I was expecting a higher class of customer service. They clearly just want to make money and don't actually value customer satisfaction.

As my relative lives close to the store in Halifax NS (Halifax shopping centre location), she offered to drop it off. I do not live close to a store nor close to my relative. When she did go to the store, the lululemon store refused to put the money back on my credit card as she did not physically have the card.

Instead, they gave her a gift card for the value which I do not want. I want the refund back on my card but am now stuck with a gift card I will not use and cannot return.

"Do not order online with lululemon. This is the second time I have ordere, and the delivery has taken a ridiculous length of time to arrive.

I reached out on Thursday the 19th, and was told to get back in touch at the end of the day on Friday the 20th. When I did, their lines were closed. I have just been on a live chat with a girl who told me that my item was 'still within standard business day delivery' - then said later that she mistook the 8 for a 3 and that Royal Mail had an issue. I was never told about this, and when I expressed my concerns to the assistant, she told me that I was expected to get in touch with lululemon if my order doesn't arrive within 3-5 business days. I did this on Thursday the 19th - exactly within this time frame - and was told to come back another day when their lines were closed. When I told the assistant this she said that 'I ended the chat', seemingly implying that this was my fault... I am appalled at this poor customer service. The assistant did not help, just kept saying 'it is on it's way'. I should really hope so given that I've already waited 10 days and now have to wait another 2.

"Another… “this used to be my favorite brand”! What happened to this company and to the product?? My all time favorite leggings were the Wunder Under Luon material… the cottony material was so comfortable, never rolled at the waist and was warm in the winter and cool in the summer. They applied just enough compression, but not so much that you felt like you couldn’t breathe. Best leggings ever. Me and my girls (a group of 15) have all boycotted Lululemon… however, we still stop in periodically to laugh at the prices, and to see and hope that one day we might just find the wunder under luon leggings.The slicker versions they now have all roll at the waist… the luon material stays put.I do enjoy the align leggings, soft and buttery, but good for nothing aside from lounging. They show EVERY FLAW… no compression whatsoever. I’ve also tried all of the “new” versions and none are comfortable. People who now buy this brand are just buying it cause they think the name matters. What a waste. If they want to see what the public wants, bring some real people on board to test and rate your products.

"I am reviewing Lululemon as this is the SECOND incident with the same answers and exact same type of negative transaction. On both occasions, one being in Feb 2023 and one today Sept 26, 2023. I purchased an item and it has been ""waiting carrier pickup"" for six days now. I have now called customer service three times and have had such frustrating answers. You cannot speak to anybody in management for three days, They give you a gift card but then they tell you to cancel the item and re-order it and hopefully, you might get it as inventory is low. I cannot use the gift card as that could take another one to three days for processing. Sure, so I should lay out the full amount again and then be left with a card to use. Perhaps I do not want to buy from them again. When asked to have the agent call T force delivery and follow up on my package, the reply was we can't do that. I took my time to call to find out that Lululemon ships it via a third party to TForce. I was also told by Lululemon, that there could be an issue with inventory. Well, they took my money! I also ordered a jacket, they took that money as well and then canceled that order saying no stock. Well, the next day I go online, and magic, again that jacket appears. So, I order it again, and within one day I get a notice of carrier pickup and delivery date for this Friday. What is going on with Lululemon. Their customer service doesn't work with agents working from home and no outside access to get answers in a timely manner.

"After recommended by a few friends, I shopped from Lululemon website a couple weeks ago, were amazed by their products. Even it's more pricey than other similar products on the market, I think it was worth it for the quality.Yesterday I passed their shop in London Canary Wharf and decided to have a quick browse, in the end also got a flare trousers (sale item) from the shop. I was rushing in and out for 5mins as needed to go back to the office with the impression to try them on at home. I wasn't informed the sales item cannot be refunded or exchanged during the purchase. Little did I know, the trousers were too long for me, so I went back during lunchtime today. One staff told me about the policy and she was going back and forth about the policy without hearing my explanation and showing even tiny bit of sympathy. She said there is literally nothing she can do to help me (which was wrong, apparently you could alter the length of the trousers). I escalated it to the manager who had even worse attitude. Anyway, again he said nothing I can help you with then walked off. I mentioned are you literally just gonna walk off in the middle of the conversation? Can I please escalate in any way or record your name so I can mention this when I speak to someone? He then called security to the shop. I explained everything to the security team and they fully understood my situation, the manager refused to come out from his office, another staff mentioned about altering idea which resolved the problem in the end. I was so shocked with the service I received. I didn't even want to step to the shop again, the lady who offered me altering the trousers said she will get them delivered so I don't need to go in anymore which was a relief.It shocks me that someone who has lack of interpersonal and basic communication skills can manage a store...

I've been contacting GEC chat multiple times, seriously got the chat closed to my face AT LEAST 30 times. 1. Ive never been disrespectful and 2. I was not AFK. They politely tell you to f*** off and close the chat without providing any assistance if they don't have an right-away copy/paste sentence to answer your question. GEC resolution team is just as bad as chat service. In 7 emails I have not received any useful feedback or assistance; again they send copy/paste paragraph. In a year i've bought over 10 pairs of leggings, two outdoor jacket, 7 joggers and multiple bras. Not a single item is still in good condition. Jackets are pilling like crazy inside, all my joggers waistband are folded in half and don't hold anything, leggings are all pilling as well, sport bras straps are now loose and i'm 32A, not 36DD. To me this is a MAJOR QUALITY ISSUE. However don't think of reaching out asking for assistance with a quality issue, they will ignore you, don't assist if they do respond and you will waste your time. I also had an employee telling me on the chat (transcription saved for reference) to hire a lawyer to contact Lululemon. In-store experience was just as terrible, i've been told my the sale representative that Lululemon never sold any Align in 28"" and to go shop somewhere else after I politely said I was looking for the lenght 28"" and couldnt find it on their shelves. (I have 4 pairs in Align 28 at home...) I've been waiting for over 6 months for resolution, still none. I never receive the promised gift card Resolution team told me I would receive for all the trouble and bad experience. Last correspondence after months of not receiving a reply was ""Oh we can't locate the mention of gift card."" Do yourself a favor and go shop somewhere else. Lululemon is now just a name, there's absolutely no reason to pay a high-end price for this cheap quality and awful customer service.","{'neg': 0.103, 'neu': 0.831, 'pos': 0.065, 'compound': -0.9215}",-0.9215,Negative

I emailed them immediately on the issue, no response.Got in touch with them on Dec 2, GEC educator confirmed that the logo shouldn’t be there and assured me they will send a replacement. Few days later I still haven’t heard from them, I got in rock with them again and another GEC educator confirmed that they are working on it and a “replacement be be sent soon”. A week later I received an emailed that says that they won’t be sending it because what I received is indeed the item, despite that I had attached pictures of the discrepancy. I believe what happened was I received a random piece of legging with the tag of what I ordered, and their response is either 1) ignore 2) admit and assure to send a replacement 3) deny completely and back track whats been said.Just unbelievable and unacceptable for so call high end athleisure brand, from this onwards I will never purchase from this brand ever again.

While ordering, it was difficult to actually pay for the item ( half of the address was cut off from the confirmation preview). Anyway, managed at the end. Then I was notified by UPS that the first line of the address is missing they are trying to resolve the issue. Not one phone call/ voicemail/ email or anything came from UPS or Lululemon trying to figure out the rest of the address- which I manually amended after having trouble ordering through PayPal. Anyway, 2 days went passed, nothing happened, so I attempted to live chat lululemon, apparently no “Educator” was available to help so I called. Yet still, I was not able to speak to anyone, it appears they were closed on this day( a random Monday, not a bank holiday) . So tried to contact UPS and help them update the address. If you've ordered via a 3rd party, they say you need to contact the company. So the next day tried again. Exactly the same experience. And they are closed again. Reached out to the only email address I could find which was apparently for the   North American customers. They would not forward the email or help me in any way unless I asked them to direct me on how to contact the UK customer service. I’ve been given a link - which is the most laughable. Anyway, apparently this is not the customer service they provide to guests :) and they’re transferring my refund back which they release immediately but MY BANK takes approx 10 working days to send it back to me.

On their store they ask for your US size but the sizing assistant they have tells you your UK size and i got it from the UK store — I was a bit unsure what to go for as I’m usually a size 6 - 10, (though I’m currently more on the size 10 side of things with my weight fluctuation), which would be size 2 - 6 in US. I ended up going with a 6 as that was the middle ground, and it ended up fitting perfectly!","{'neg': 0.027, 'neu': 0.809, 'pos': 0.164, 'compound': 0.9866}",0.9866,Positive
I purchased about 2 months ago a pair of their high rise shorts. Always bought Lulu because of the quality. I have a pair of the same shorts that lasted 5 years. That’s why I didn’t have a problem spending $70 for a new pair. Well the draw string in the front became undone and was impossible for me to fix as I would have. I notified the company getting different reps and it seems like they did not care about the defect. I usually do not write reviews but I am pissed about thisSeemed that their quality is no longer great😡,"{'neg': 0.141, 'neu': 0.826, 'pos': 0.033, 'compound': -0.8925}",-0.8925,Negative
"I have spent a lot of money over the years at Lululemon.  My teenage daughter recently received two eGift cards at two separate times.  When she went to spend them, both are showing a balance of 0. I called the ""customer education service"" number and was quickly and immediately told it must have been her email that was compromised, as Lululemon has a secure site and gift cards are essentially treated as cash.  The representative was able to tell me the date the gift cards were redeemed, and where the merchandise was sent.  One was a location in Guilford Towne Centre, Canada and the other New York, NY ( I am not geographically close to either of those places).  I have a hard time believing that my teenage daughter's two SEPARATE email accounts just happened to be compromised for a two $50 Egift cards, and no other gift cards from other retailers were?  Did the same hacker just magically access two separate email accounts in opposing months, targeting teens who had a Lululemon gift card on their otherwise unappealing accounts?  Since someone in Canada used one, is it possible you have an internal problem with theft?  At the very least, it does seem as though this is an internal issue with security on Lululemon's part, and they have failed to address it based on the multiple reports I have read that date back over two years now.  Even customers who deposit gift cards onto their personal app have been compromised, so it does not stop with digital gifting.  A company that sees profits such as Lululemon should have security as a top priority.  An easy solution, and one any IT department should be able to handle, is a one-email verification.  If you cannot sign in with the email the gift card was assigned to, that eliminates a huge deal of digital theft that is occurring.  I was given a very snarky, repetitive and canned response from the representative-it is evident they see this quite a bit and have rehearsed what to say.  ""I'm sure you feel frustrated"" doesn't provide a solution that your company has been aware of for years.  This lack of security and customer support, coupled with declining quality of merchandise is enough to lose my business to the other competitors who are doing it right.","{'neg': 0.049, 'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.128, 'compound': 0.9804}",0.9804,Positive

A customer service agent hung up on me and told me not to contact them again the last time that I called for an update, and since then they have stopped responding to emails requesting external dispute resolution.

"To date, I have placed three orders. Every order has gone wrong. My first order came with security tags attached. It’s a very common problem for security tags to come attached to orders, apparently. I am a remote person without a car. I can’t just go into a store and I think it’s crazy that they expect people to do that. I received a $30 gift card for my trouble and decided to remove the tag from my $100 bra myself which now has a huge hole in the side. I chalked it up to bad luck and decided to try again.My second order I placed stayed “processing” for 10 days. I finally called and they said that it had never been touched. Yet again, another $30 gift card was given. THEY DO NOT STACK.Here’s the kicker…On clothing that is around $100 per piece, $30 really isn’t going to do much. This is 100% a sales tactic and means of accepting poor order fulfillment/service as part of their company culture, while still getting customers to spend with them. They’ll give you $30 all day long. But they don’t stack and you can’t actually buy anything with it, unless you pay them more.I waited for 10 days for the funds to return on my card, then I placed another order. Today, I found two holds — but I had only placed one new order. After an hour with customer service today, we finally found they had re-tried my card after the fact, and still never shipped my order. This added an additional 3-10 days on the funds holding clock. I have now waited 18 days and still have not been returned my money from the order I placed. They literally can’t give me my money back, either. I just have to wait.

"I’m not the type of person to leave negative feedback, but I experienced an extreme level of abuse and racism by the security member at the lululemon store on Grafton street on December 31st 2021.  I have never in my life experienced this type of behaviour.  I was in the Lululemon store on Grafton street on New Year’s Eve.  I  tried on a couple of items and decided on my purchases at the fitting rooms, I quickly pulled down my mask to sip out of my coffee before heading to the checkout.  Out of nowhere, the security guard approached me with a serious  attitude telling me to pull up my mask down and not to drink my coffee in the store.  I understand when there are store policies entirely and would respect them but the way he approached me so aggressively  was completely out of order.He was very full on and I was in shock by his tone of voice and manner for a simple mistake.  I couldn’t believe what had just happened . Initially I was shocked but then I came to my senses & I went over to him to let him know that that’s not an acceptable way to speak to your customers.  There is  a respectable way of asking someone not to drink coffee in-store and to pull up the mask.  He then proceeded to abuse me further at the lulu lemon store entrance, he said  that I was the issue and not him and that he worked most of his life and ""people like me"" don’t even know what work is (I have 2 jobs)  he proceeded to shout that I was the problem. I doubt I am the only customer he has had in store who put their mask down for a moment and i would hope that this isn't how he treats other customers on a daily basis.

"Recently purchased Lululemon socks. They look good and the material feels like it's of a decent quality. However, the construction is poor. They have a weird built-in heel thing that doesn't fit me at all. I can't image it would fit most people, so it would do what it does with me and stick out like a odd heel nose.  Inevitably the heel bunches up when you put shoes on, which leads to rubbing and blisters. The socks also shrink like crazy in the wash.

"I was eager to try a new brand of running apparel... Lululemon isn’t best known for men’s running gear but I decided to take a plunge and give them go. My grey running shorts showed sweat marks after a short run, while I expect sweat the colour or material wasn’t compatible for this and I wondered how they came to produce these without noticing such a big design flaw. (The price is almost double that of my grey Nike running shorts and I have no problem with them.) I emailed customer services and was told I had to submit a returns request and someone would get back to me within 7 days. 16 days later after me messaging them numerously requesting an update I was told that they would not be accepting the return. This was contradictory to what it says on the returns note ‘if you are not happy with your product or your product doesn’t perform for you then you can return it’. After persisting and making a complaint they agreed to send me a discount off of my next purchase, and said I should receive an email within 48 hours. A few more emails were sent back and forth as I hadn’t received it and it finally arrived after a week!What a waste of time and a disappointing first experience, at the prices they are charging I would have expected better handling from their customer services.

I was told that while they pride themselves on creating long-lasting gear, this is not a manufacturing issue and no return would be permitted. Apparently a hole can only appear in pants as a result of accidental damage and has nothing to do with how the item was made.Not sure if I can really agree with that, but one thing I do know is that with 100+ companies that make the same exact clothing, I can find the same if not better quality elsewhere.","{'neg': 0.081, 'neu': 0.841, 'pos': 0.078, 'compound': -0.1857}",-0.1857,Negative
"I own many Lululemon products to give you an over view over 50 pairs of shorts, 30 pairs of pants, numerous amounts of  jackets,scuba zip ups and reflective pullovers and APLsneakers until they stopped selling them. This is where I am comfortable with truly being able to rate Lululemon products, quality fit etc, from past to present. I have seen since 2019 the quality of Lululemon and their customer service has gone completely down hill. Before 2019 Lululemon  took pride in Amazing quality and Amazing Customer service to include fixing their Lululemon brand clothing via their selected stores. Right before the pandemic I needed some stuff fixed that were pretty new. I had only worn them a few times and they were starting unravel at the seams so I brought them in to the Natick store where they have seamstress they asked me if I had a tag from the online. I told the girl I have never had to do that before as I’ve always brought my Lululemon clothing directly into the store to have the seam fixed if it’s coming on done as I own many pairs of Lululemon clothes and even to this day I have white and blue Mind over Miles tights still with tags on them. Anyways the girl ended up taking my scuba sweatshirt and fixing the seam line with the zipper. But you would’ve thought I was asking her to sow the whole entire jacket together front start to finish as they do in the factoryI  was very disappointed and that’s my personal journey as to how it continued to make me now want to buy and support Lululemon as their quality and service were not what it once was. I will never forget the time reflective jacket that cost $228 when I contacted Lululemon headquarters directly they were kind enough to help me.Now that is in the past no matter how new your Lululemon clothing is  you’ll get someone telling you at the Natick store that it looks like it’s been well loved r that they can’t fix it because of whatever excuse they happen to give you that day.  I know how many times I wear certain pants in particular one in particular our my black Sleet Sprinter Pants I would say yes they are well loved and to be honest I wish Lululemon would bring this particular winter gear back as it’s amazing quality it has lasted many years.

I could wait to get them and I was Completely Disappointed in the over all quality and make.

It’s sad because I personally looked forward to the newest products, great quality with the best and brightest colors.

"Lululemon has the worst quality control over sale items, and they won't approve your review about negative experience.My experience is the final sale items highly likely to be defect, so don't buy.Lululemon just assuming all negative reviews are bad customer that want to return the used item. I would like to hear others experience before making a purchase of sale items. If I know sale=final sale= defect or used. I will think about it.The final sale items are likely having tag pinned on the cloth, which means you never qualify for a return if something wrong with the item because they need to confirm the tag is still on, which never on when it arrived. And they make you feel like you are a bad customer just want to get returns after using the items.My experience is I got a jacket with a hair sewed in the cuff by manufacturers that I can not take it out myself. Plus it's kinda disgusting to do so. Another it's a used jacket that smell like Tide. The second one I just put in washer. The first one it's in trash now...Don’t know how to attach their emails for not approving my reviews and assuming I want a return and tell me need tag on to qualify. And also want to attach the hair in cuff of the jacket.Tip for consumers:Lululemon doesn’t stand behind their quality, so final sale means used clothes or defect without return. Don’t trust their customer service about offering a return, they will never accept their fault and only issue a one time exception. Unless you feel comfortable about accepting their kind exception and admit they have not fault and you are just a bad customer wants a return.","{'neg': 0.128, 'neu': 0.782, 'pos': 0.09, 'compound': -0.9515}",-0.9515,Negative

No real follow up, no phone call, nothing.

Of course, someone answered the chat during my 10 min call.  Murphy's law.  Went on chat bot again today - over an hour wait.  And, Lulu says, yes, your order was lost in transit... we'll reprocess order in 3-5 days and I'd get another email when it finally processes. So, I said ""really"" and then another 10 days for it to arrive?  They said, we can just refund your money. And, I said that I'd like to have the product that I ordered, I just didn't think that it would take over 20+ days to receive it. And, that's NOT the level of service that I expect from the Lulu.

LOL - I would never have ordered an extra small for my 18 year old - OMG.  Filled out a return and asked for a credit at Lulu since I'm reordering the pants.  Well, no credit appeared within 24 hours so I'm paying another  $138 to have the pants shipped out today (4th time). I am on hold for an hour w/ CS again. I told my son... it's xmas in Feb!

I said so you’d rather lose the sale than exchange it at the same price how does that make any business sense? She said that’s all I can do. So I said ok then you’ve lost my business and she laughed.

Said she doesn’t see any quality issue without look at my legging at all. She said even I paid over 110 for it. But was on sale. There is nothing she can do.that I should decide before I buy a sale item. That’s the risk to take. I ask for the manager. Get the same answer! I am very disappointed how they treated me. I always loved lululemon. But the store worker has been mean and rude.

"Hello, I have supported Lululemon from its early days when it started in my city and all the while as it grew into a worldwide corporation. I own many pieces of their clothing, however after recently going through my closet I noted that I do have about 15 particular items that have only been worn a handful of times due to their quality. For example, the 'wonder under' high rise leggings, 'stride jacket', a pair of their ruched leggings, a rash guard, tank top with unraveling threads, merino wool gloves, dress and sweater (itchy, although being advertised as soft), they just sit and look pretty in my closet. They have not served a practical purpose for me so I ended up wasting my money on products that are of bad quality and lack longevity. After many emails back and forth, where I described the items (visuals and details), I was told that they do not fall under their quality promise guarantee. Customer service has kept playing back the same rhetoric, so much that it doesn't even make sense anymore. For example, I explained how their not so 'wunder under' leggings constantly roll down after 10 minutes of wear, resulting in a muffin top (a very obvious defect), I kept getting the same response of how Lululemon does not cover items exposed to 'excessive force/damage'. This left me scratching my head as they have only been worn a handful of times (due to rolling down); they have been like this from the very beginning and only exposed to cold water wash. Lululemon items are SO expensive, so of course a person is going to take note of how to take care of these pieces of clothing. I am Extremely disappointed with how this company absolutely refuses to take any responsibility for selling items that are indeed, faulty. After many years as a loyal client, I am no longer interested in purchasing items that can be hit or miss and then NOT covered by a quality promise in the end (something that is only stated to secure sales for the company, but not to put the mind of the buyer at ease, so beware!)

"Used to be a good company not entirely sure what happened... Yesterday I called Lulu in regards to a price-adjustment on an item I had purchased online during the week of their ""biggest online sale"". Less than a week later the item had been further reduced by $30 and moved to their ""We've Made Too Much"" section. This being my first time for calling to see if it was possible as I always purchase my items at the full price range as sales for Lulu are rare online. The lady I spoke with on their guest education was terrible. Excuse after excuse on why a $30 price adjustment couldn't be given as it was ""policy"" and couldn't provide much more detail than rehearsed script with a whole lot of attitude. She was willing to supply a $15 gift card for inconvenience- as appreciative as I was in regards to the gesture I was not looking for $15 on inconvenience and just straight principle. I asked if a $30 gift card could be done considering the price was adjusted by $30 in less than a week. At the end of the day if they could not give money back I would have happily accepted it in a gift card form to have been applied to a future purchase from Lulu. When the rep advised me she couldn't not do anything further as it was policy and they are only allowed to allot certain amounts to certain issues I had advised that's fine and will try to reach out to someone else as she had advised me earlier on the call they don't have managers. The rep proceeded to tell me to consider calling another day as I will only get her. What kind of company does not have managers? or any level of escalation for that matter? Disappointing to see such a huge corporation penny pinch and have the worst customer service set up I have ever experienced.Needless to say I'll consider my shopping elsewhere and will let others know the terrible experience as well to keep this from happening to them!","{'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.837, 'pos': 0.106, 'compound': 0.8995}",0.8995,Positive

"I have had two seriously terrible experiences with Lululemon, and one lukewarm encounter. Both the terrible experiences concerned quality control issues made worst by terrible customer service. (Terrible 1) Spring 2019, I bought two pairs of Slim Commission pants in 30/34. The two pairs were sized inconsistently. Specifically, one pair was 1.5 inches too wide on the waist. The lack of quality control was actually astounding for pants that are nearly $150/pair. However, the lack of quality customer service was way worse. When I immediately brought it to Lululemon's attention, I was told too bad too sad. I could return for store credit and then wait over a week for a new pair to come in, which I ended up forced into doing. I bit my tongue and justified it because I loved the pants that did fit. (Lukewarm 1) Spring 2020, two of my Commission slims (I was now up to three) had gotten the same hole along stitching near the crotch. I have no idea how these expensive pants could deteriorate so quickly, particularly because I am OCD with these pants. I hardly wear / wash, and when I do wash its: alone / cold / delicate / hand dry. Yet it happened. I am categorizing this one as only lukewarm because I got one of the pairs replaced. However, I need to circle up with the other pair, and I was told by a store rep that they wouldn't help me (Michigan Ave Chicago store). Moreover, these pants shouldn't get holes along stitching like that. Its total BS. Shame on LULU.(Terrible 2) Summer 2020, my replacement pair came in the mail (see Lukewarm 1), and I was horrified to discover another sizing inconsistency problem. This pair was much tighter than my existing pairs. In fact, this pair had a waist two inches smaller than my other pairs and an ankle opening a half inch smaller. What the H**** LULULEMON. Again, I went to the store so I could try on other pairs and a couple sizes to understand what was going on. I walked thirty minutes to a store, and I had to wait in the heat for another thirty minutes to be allowed in due to COVID. When I get in they tell me they have NO 30/34 or 31/34 slim pants. Like not none in the color I wanted; straight-up NONE. How is that even possible. I was annoyed. I explained the quality control issue I had, and got horrible customer service. They refused to help and told me to try coming back in a week. This is not how high end brands behave towards customers.

Currently stores are closed, Canada post is backlogged! if you order online and you need to return they need to receive the product before they issue you a refund.. it has ALWAYS been like this.

"We are very disappointed with this purchase. My 13-year-old has been saving up for months to get her one and only pair of lululemon leggings. She was trying to save money by getting a pair in the""sale"" section. We looked at the model that represented which said she was 5' 10"" and wore a size 6 and thought, a 2 would be perfect since that is exactly what she wears for EVERYTHING else. She tracked the package and couldn't wait for them to arrive. She received the package and even did an""opening video"" and couldn't wait to try them on. She put them on and couldn't even get them above her knees. She said they were so tight and small that they wouldn't even work. So, my 10-year-old tried them on, who wears a size 7-8 GIRLS and they fit perfectly. My oldest daughter was so upset. So, we tried to go online and fix the problem. We couldn't return them, we couldn't exchange them, and we couldn't get a hold of anyone on live chat, email, or call! This was the most frustrating thing to go through. And, we are out $80that my daughter worked so hard to save up and order these with. And, she is upset that now her sister gets to wear them and she doesn't get the leggings SHE ordered! I am trying to teach my children the value of money, but I feel this was a complete WASTE and I would have a very hard time letting them order again. Also, don't tell a 13-year-old girl, who usually wears a size 2, that she should wear an 8??? That is a horrible self-esteem thing you might not want them to have issues with later on in life. The quality of the pants was great! The 10-year-old loves them. I just wish it would have worked out better for my daughter who actually ordered them. AND!

They then stated that they would send me another and the return authorization slip. I got the labels, no slip. Then needed to contact them again.

"I've been a Lululemon fan for about 3 years until last december when one of my running jackets started to fall apart as my zipper would come undone while I was running. I immediately took it back and their tailor in the Flatiron location told me that it was suppose to do just that to keep me cool while running, makes no sense. Then the zipper started to get stuck and I took it back again and their manager looked at it and said nothing to assure me the zipper would get better then about week later the entire zipper broke and I couldn't take it off - I brought it over my head. Once again, I went back and this time i asked for an exchange. The sales guy told me they were out of my size and the only place that would have it was their 5th avenue location which I agree to take the subway to that location. To my surprise and shock, the sales woman did not want to exchange it as apparently their was a note in my file saying, 'dont let him exchange anything'.  I was offended and insulted as I've spent so much money on their clothes and to be treated like a con artist was beyond disrespectful for a client like myself. After an unpleasant exchange of words with the manager, she agreed to exchange it for me. I couldn't believe the sales guy at the Flatiron location would write something as awful like that as I consider myself a loyal fan, up until last month. I've NEVER returned anything as I'm always pleased with their athletic apparel and I have spent a good amount of money in the last 3 years as I'm muscular and this brand was a perfect fit for my body type.I was so angry I went immediately back to the Flatiron location and asked to speak to the manager and her excuse was that the note was gone and her sales team has no access of entering notes in their clients files, I didn't buy this at all!! I'm already looking for other similar brands to Lululemon where I'm not treated like a thief!The coat I'm referring to is the Down For It All Jacket and retails at 200 bucks. Play with the zipper several times before purchasing it.","{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.814, 'pos': 0.112, 'compound': 0.9257}",0.9257,Positive

First time, they suggested I go to a Taylor on a sweatshirt that was ripped where the tag was. I figured ok, I’m not sending this back and spent 10 dollars on that.The second time, I got a pair of pants that were ripped at the pocket. I wasn’t taking that to a Taylor and requested a new pair to be sent. They told me to go to a store and I didn’t want to do that. They then said ok wait 24 hrs for a response to send clear pictures. I did that and was told that they wanted the pants back. I said I don’t have a box, they were clearly damaged so finally after 10 min of back and forth I was told to donate the pants and they ordered me replacements.1 hr later, I get an email saying we don’t have the pants and we need the ones you were told to donate back to get a refund. I already donated them. I order a different pair of pants.Pants #2 arrive, wrong size. Go into a store and get the right pair of pants.

The quality has gone waaay down and the prices have gone way up. I have had to return or exchange 4 items of clothing now in the past month and a half because the seams are coming apart on the pants and the shirts have material that has pulled after one wear! The pants were $150 dollars and the t-shirt was $70.... that should NOT happen. I have clothes from Lululemon from 8 years ago that still are in great shape.

Lulu Lemon has the absolute worst customer support and they provide no solutions when there are errors or issues on their end of things. My order never arrived and there were no updates on shipping.

They offered to refund me but I want the leggings I ordered. They said they had a limited number in stock so they could not guarantee a replacement order would be filled. Am I wrong or isn’t having a system that shows stock there to tell you exactly if they have the product available.

Having being a customer of Lululemon for years and once in the past returning items with no problem I really rated them and the quality and longevity of their beautiful clothing. Recently I have been let down by my normal size no longer fitting and being too big. So I returned items bought from a birthday voucher. This was beginning of December. I have given them the tracking number etc and chased and spoken to several staff. Still no refund or update. A week ago I was given a £25 gift voucher for my bad experience but no refund yet of my £96. I thought great I’ll get a tank top with that £25 voucher on the sale. Size 10 which I have ordered before in tops arrives and looks more like a size 16. It’s the UK website so I am ordering my U.K. size. Or should I be using the U.S sizing? Who knows. Very frustrated another return to be sent and who knows if that gesture of goodwill will ever be reimbursed along with my gift card and cash.

"I had heard lots of good things about Lululemon clothing so I was really excited to try out the clothing.  I placed an order with them and quickly received an email from UPS giving me a delivery date.  The parcel did not arrive on that date, or the two subsequent working days.  The tracking information also stopped being updated.  I called UPS to see what was happening.  UPS were very helpful and told me that there was clearly some kind of problem with the package but that I couldn't ask them to do anything about it and I'd have to call Lululemon to get them to raise a claim on the package through their account.  Nice and efficient...I called Lululemon and, after waiting for a patronisingly titled 'Educator' to pick up the phone, the 'Educator' informed me that I would have to wait in AGAIN, wasting more of my time, to see if the package arrived that day. If the package did not arrive, only then would they raise a claim.  The woman I spoke to was really patronising and appeared to not believe me when I told her that UPS had told me that a claim should be raised now because there was clearly a problem with the package.  It was incredibly rude of this 'Educator' to ask that I waste more of my time waiting in for a package that I had been told would not arrive BY THE PARCEL CARRIER THEMSELVES!!!  Unsurprisingly, the package did not arrive that day.  At this point, I just wanted my order cancelled, my money back and to not have to deal with Lululemon's patronising customer service ever again.  So, the next day, I called Lululemon to tell them that the package had not arrived but that I just wanted it recalled and a refund processed.  They told me that I would now have to wait another 4 working days so that UPS could find the package.  Only then could a refund be processed.  I am so, so unhappy with Lululemon's customer service.  As far as I am concerned, the missing package is now an issue between Lululemon and UPS - after all, only Lululemon could raise the claim via their account.  Despite this, Lululemon is now asking me to spend more of my time and effort resolving this issue with UPS by waiting an additional 4 working days. So far, I have wasted 2 days waiting for packages that didn't arrive (1  day of which was completely unnecessary, as I was told by the carrier that the parcel was lost!) and 1 hour of phone calls to UPS and Lululemon discussing the missing package (30 minutes of which was also unnecessary because I had to call Lululemon again to ask them raise a claim AGAIN, in accordance with their request the first time I called them).  Now, I have the joy of looking forward to 4 more working days of waiting for the issue with UPS to be resolved. Lululemon clearly do not value their customers' time or respect them.  The clothing may or may not be great - I'll never get the chance to try it.  I won't be ordering again.Update:  In classic incompetent Lululemon style, I received an email from Lululemon several days later asking me if I had received the parcel (I hadn't). I am not sure why Lululemon did not contact UPS to assess the situation, and instead decided to ask me to do their job for them!  In their email, Lululemon also advised me to call a Canadian number if I hadn't received the parcel.  If they had been competent enough to look at the UK based delivery and billing address, it might have occurred to them to send me a UK number...Anyway, I checked the UPS tracking information (because I had not received any calls, emails or missed delivery notes from UPS) and saw that UPS said the parcel had been delivered to a UPS access point and that I needed to collect it.  This was despite me telling Lululemon several times to return the parcel back to them as soon as it was found by Lululemon.I contacted Live Chat immediately and explained that the parcel should have been returned to Lululemon. The agent was very helpful and quick to respond (hence why I have increased my review from 1 to 2 stars) and issued my refund immediately.","{'neg': 0.073, 'neu': 0.863, 'pos': 0.064, 'compound': -0.8809}",-0.8809,Negative

So I contacted a few of their stores to speak to an actual person and at all location received an answering machine, who even uses these anymore??

I even explained how I don't use their products because they don't make my size in tops and for bottoms I don't like their fit. They were pretty rude about it and told me we were simply out that money or to trade it with someone else or to buy an accessory.

"Before I found Lululemon, I thought that finding aesthetically pleasing yet also durable workout attire was impossible. I’ve been a sweaty generalist for about three years now, and have struggled tremendously when it comes to finding clothes that don’t make me feel sloppy while I work out. I’ve bought all sorts of different brands, expensive and cheap, and could never find a perfect pair of leggings. When the European brand Gymshark first became popular, I was super into their leggings. As a girl with hips, it can be ridiculously hard to find leggings that are squat-proof but don’t slip off my waist. A couple of years ago, Gymshark released a line of “Flex” leggings that contour your butt and have a thick waistband on top to prevent any slippage. As the leggings were a bit out of my high-school-junior budget, I drooled over them online until I could finally afford to splurge. I bought a pair of gray Flex leggings with a pink waistband and wore those bad boys until they were too worn out to wear. I actually just recently dropped them at my local thrift, and a couple tears might’ve been shed. Those leggings saw me through every new workout max; I squatted 185 lbs in them - a goal that took me a whole year to reach. I’ve had a couple of other pairs of Flex leggings since that first beloved pair, and they’re still my designated leg-day leggings. They’re squat proof and comfy, and I guess I have a bit of bias since they were my first pair of “cool gym girl” leggings.When I graduated high school I decided I wanted some high quality leggings that weren’t only for working out. I’ve known about Lululemon leggings for quite a while but since they’re super expensive I never really considered buying them until then. I stalked a whole bunch of fitness models’ Instagram accounts to see if the hype was worth it, and I decided it was. I bought the 25” Align Pant 2’s in black and almost died at how perfect they were, so I took every precaution I could to prevent hurting them. I never wore them to the gym because I was so afraid they’d get ruined, and washed them alone and air-dried them like the tag said to do. But after only a few weeks they started to pill. I did read all the reviews thoroughly before I dropped that hundred bucks, and did see that other people had complained about the pills but I still went for it. Since I do have thicker thighs I expected it might happen at some point. At first the pills weren’t too bad and didn’t seem to be getting worse. But one day I wore them on a hike and when I got home the inner thighs were almost completely covered in pills; I was so disappointed because they were the softest, most flattering leggings I’d ever worn. I kept wearing them since I wasn't about to just throw away a pair of such beautiful leggings, but they never really felt the same. Eventually they were so pilled I could barely wear them, so I emailed the Lulu staff to see if I had any options. I was so shocked to find that I could get a brand new pair if I mailed them back. I hadn’t known prior, but Lululemon stands behind all of their gear so if something isn’t holding up well they’ll replace it for you. Within two weeks I had a brand new pair of beautiful Aligns that I vow to never wear hiking again. As I’ve said before, these leggings are so soft and flattering, but if you’re looking for a more durable pair I’d definitely go for a different style like the In Movement leggings (which are also super soft but more durable.) Lululemon uses different materials for different leggings- the Aligns are made of Nulu fabric that is buttery soft and feels so light it’s like they’re barely there. Since this material is more delicate, it’s not the best for high-friction workouts such as running or hiking. Stating the obvious here- a hundred dollars for a pair of pants you have to be so careful with is kind of a lot of money. However, if you’re willing to pay the price these leggings are flattering and beautiful and really can’t be beat. Once I started wearing Lululemons I could never wear any other brands (besides Gymshark). Although the price is high, Lululemon leggings are the best workout pants you will ever have, and the customer service is unmatched. If your Lulus don’t hold up, take them to a local store or simply email customer service and they’ll make it right. Yes, they’re pricey, but the quality and customer service Lululemon offers makes the whole experience so worth it.","{'neg': 0.087, 'neu': 0.813, 'pos': 0.1, 'compound': 0.8806}",0.8806,Positive

I love lululemon! They have great customer service. I had a three year old pair of leggings which they no longer sell and I could remember the type or size. They lasted a long time but the seam came apart. I emailed and got a response within a few days and a full refund although I was required to send back the pants but the shipping was paid for by them. As well I love that they are branching out more into lifestyle clothing as opposed to the traditional yoga/workout wear. A big plus for me as well is free shipping (at least in Canada) as often I'll abandon my order why I find out how much shipping costs. This helps make up for the expense of the clothes. Tried and true fan! 100% would reccommend and I personally love the On The Fly Pant as they are one of the most versatile items in my closet.,"{'neg': 0.031, 'neu': 0.755, 'pos': 0.214, 'compound': 0.9869}",0.9869,Positive

"Putting aside the cost of Lululemon apparel, it is beautifully made and fantastically comfortable to wear. I have their basic long sleeve tee and its my absolute favourite. So why 2 stars?

"I would have preferred 21/2 stars, but I went up to three.  This is as the sales lady honored  her word to return a sale item, sale items are final.

I wore it at home and it felt snug thus I returned it, she provided a full money back refund.   I liked her too she was genuine and sincerely concerned that the Hoodie should be comfortable.  I am a size five, but Lulu. does not carry in between sizes, which they might consider doing.  As well a key concern is  the fabrics are a poly/cotton mix, I only wear 100% cotton and most items at Lululemon are a synthetic/cotton mix.   As well as people are increasingly concerned re: their health and the environment they like fabrics made from organic cotton, organic hemp and bamboo for example. I wear organic bamboo socks/and bamboo yoga pants.   Thus I find the Lululemon brand is focused on health and wellbeing but their products which contain large amounts of synthetic fabrics is opposite to their brand.    I actually get a rash from wearing synthetic fibers, poly is made from oil.  I am not anti oil, albeit we are transitioning to renewables globally but I do not like to wear oil based products for obvious reasons.","{'neg': 0.014, 'neu': 0.843, 'pos': 0.143, 'compound': 0.9856}",0.9856,Positive

"I enjoy hot yoga and was tired of the wet sliding warriors and furling towel issues, so my yogi let me try her black rubber mat from lulu - loved it - so went to Bellevue Square store in Washington to buy one. They don't make the sticky rubber mat anymore, so I spent time talking with a sales woman about my needs for a super-sticky no-slip hot yoga mat - they did not have any unrolled to try out - the sales woman she steered me to the 3mm mat - and also advised, ""try it out, if it doesn't work then bring it back"". So I did try it out and it was just as slippery as my old mat. I cleaned it after one class, and took it back to the store with my receipt, and was told that it could not be returned unless I had the original packaging - which amounted to a piece of saran wrap plastic that went around the center of the roll. I told the clerk I wanted my money back - gave her receipt and clean mat - and she steered me to contact the online customer service - I told her I did not want to do that since I still have a mat I don't want - I want my money back. She wouldn't do it - would only give me store credit. I am so frustrated by this store not standing behind their products, giving out bad advice, and not giving a lick about a good customer experience. I took the store credit and will give it away to a yogi in need. I am never shopping at lulu again.

"I had a very positive experience with this company several years ago. So when I decided to up the quality (& size) of my yoga mat in the summer of 2016, I really didn't hesitate to spend in excess of $100 for the mat & strap. Quality has been subpar. The rubber/PU compound has simply not stood up well at all.  At both ends of the mat, the material has deteriorated / stretched out so that it actually buckles causing my feet to slide, well within 6 months of purchase. I should add that I use it 3-4 X per week, I am a man 6'3"", 175 pounds. Never hot yoga or even power yoga for that matter. It is an oversize, reversible mat. Based on the online reviews, it seemed as though it would be a good quality purchase, from a respectable customer focused company. I stopped by the local store where it was purchased, earlier this year to inquire about this issue. At this time I was asked to bring in the mat. 2 weeks ago I did. The staff member was quite friendly and accommodating. She agreed to replace the mat. Then when retrieving one from the shelf, they realized that mine was oversized (big). It was explained to me a the store had no stock of this item and that a replacement would need to be ordered. The ensuing confusion in regards to the process of ordering a replacement was almost comical. I volunteered to pay, in advance, for the replacement mat (even though I had paid for the original as well) in order to keep and use the original until such time as the replacement arrived. So a week later I received an email from Lululemon that my mat had arrived (as well as a pair of shorts I ordered at that time) and that I could pick up the items at any time. So I went to the store an hour or so later. The shorts they found right away. I stood around for about 30 minutes waiting for the mat to be located. Eventually it was determined that the staff were unable to locate the mat BUT it may be in the multiple unpacked boxes received in the back. I was told to expect a phone call before close that day to advise me of the status. Nothing. Frustrated, the following morning I went on the Lululemon 'live chat'. Again I left quickly with zero news. Then again last Friday I went on the 'live chat'. I guess that the company is extraordinarily disorganized. I received the excuse of ""FedEx"" lost the shipment... We require 4 businesses days to inquire, you will receive an email the following day, Saturday. So I did indeed receive a comical email Saturday, just checking to see if I had yet received my order. You have to be joking, it was being shipped to your store. I was getting (even more) irate at the inept service at this point, and replied to the email expressing my displeasure, reiterating the fact that I had paid for the replacement mat almost 2 weeks prior, and Lululemon didn't appear to be serious about providing me with a resolution to their screw up. Apparently they have issued a credit to my card (why this could possibly take several days to ""process"" is beyond me, the payment certainly showed up instantly. So I still have a defective mat, no refund as of this morning. Apparently 2 stores about an hour away do have the mat in stock. I quess I will take my chances with a replacement next time it is convenient to get there. VERY DISSATISFIED CUSTOMER. PS. The shorts I ordered are still in the package, so based on the experience I have decided to return them. This morning I go on the Lululemon site and follow through to the return page only to be informed that I have no purchase. Bizarre.Just a quick update. The shorts. I have returned to the company, eventually with the support of an employee I did receive the proper return email. I have kept up with the tracking via FedEx, they received last week and no news yet. The mat. I was downtown a couple of weeks ago and had an extra hour, so I went to the Lululemon store and they exchanged the mat for a new one. I hope it stands up a bit better. The company is incredibly disorganized, I recognize the 'modern' version of customer service removes any personal treatment...it is an issue with most bigger companies. I only wish that after such a colossal screw up by the company, that perhaps 1 person could be assigned to make sure the customer was being looked after, reassuring communication is always a good thing. The cost of my driving around, parking, time... Has never once been acknowledged. A simple 'thanks' frequently goes a long way! Overall I would give this company a 1.5 / 5 for the customer service. Most of the people involved were decent and accommodating. They did accept returns. However the corporate policy is abhorrent with almost all focus on the company and their bottom line. Communication is very poor as I was forced to initiate all correspondence.Quick update.  The replacement yoga mat performed exactly as poorly as the initial one... Less than 6 months of decent use... So rather than attempt to deal with the Lululemon juggernaut of incompetent customer service... I simply ordered a new mat from a competitor... Manduka. Now I have had this mat for app 4 or 5 months now... Hands down a much more pleasant experience. I strongly recommend anyone shopping for a new yoga mat to avoid Lululemon at all cost and explore the alternatives... For me the manduka pro extra long mat is perfect.","{'neg': 0.07, 'neu': 0.848, 'pos': 0.082, 'compound': 0.883}",0.883,Positive
"I ordered some of their products and I am not happy about it. First of all, they check your credit card paying ability by withdrawing 5 $ from it. I still have not gotten them back although it`s been a month since the purchase. Moreover, the product got to my place with a one-week delay and in bad condition. The colour of the T-shirt I ordered doesn`t match with the one depicted on their web-site. P.S. I am going to order something else that is for sure!","{'neg': 0.103, 'neu': 0.815, 'pos': 0.082, 'compound': -0.4386}",-0.4386,Negative
"Ordered, money taken from card but receive email saying your order is cancelled.You have to ring them to find your order is out of stock and advised to keep ordering (and presume money being taken) until it is delivered.

Lululemon marked by mistake 6 items bought instead of 1 causing the customs to go way up. I spent with them a few hours on line. They wouldnt refund me.This is a good lesson for me and I would never order from them online again.

"Overall, Lulu is a great company. The service I have had with them has more often than not been more than pleasurable. Esp. online shopping. Talk about a breeze! Any problems I've encountered have usually been fixed immediately. Also, they really do stand by their product. If it is poorly made they will take the item back. It is true that some of their items are a bit overpriced for the quality that you get but other items are consistently well made, and those are the items I stick too.","{'neg': 0.02, 'neu': 0.874, 'pos': 0.106, 'compound': 0.7834}",0.7834,Positive
"lululemon is all about design, and trying to understand what their customer base is looking for. Sometimes they are a little off, but most of the time they are right on target! From perfect fitting yoga clothes to non-chafing running gear, they make a fantastic product that lasts a good 3 years. If you are serious about your practice or sport, lululemon is the product for you. If you're just wearing it to be trendy, it's a little expensive, because, hey! That's not was it was designed for.","{'neg': 0.015, 'neu': 0.833, 'pos': 0.152, 'compound': 0.9426}",0.9426,Positive

"I love Lululemon attire. It's not only beautiful, but it's made with little details in mind that no other fitness designer seems to think of. A little tiny pocket to slip your key in while you run so you can be hands-free and clothing that breathes and moves with you... these are just a few things that this company has managed to work into their designs. My only complaint is that the clothing is a bit overpriced. I do love the designs, but come on... $98 for a pair of yoga pants? Okay, I know they're not just *any* yoga pants, but still. I would recommend investing in one of their jackets. Can't beat the quality or the design.","{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.809, 'pos': 0.131, 'compound': 0.8743}",0.8743,Positive
