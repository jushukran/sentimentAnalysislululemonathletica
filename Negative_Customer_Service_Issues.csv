My belt bag started ripping at the corner seam within 3 months of having it. After contacting customer service they said it was over a year old and they couldn‚Äôt do anything for me. I explained the bag was only 3 months old and attached photos as well as my receipt showing the date of purchase and they told me they could no longer assist me and the case was closed. Absolutely awful customer service. This company does not stand behind their product. Do not recommend at all. ,"{'neg': 0.085, 'neu': 0.892, 'pos': 0.023, 'compound': -0.6708}",-0.6708,Negative

Tried to return faulty leggings and it was the most frustrating convoluted process I‚Äôve had online. The ‚Ç¨98 leggings were a birthday present for my daughter. Piling appeared after 1 wear and the material was poor quality. I eventually received a return label after being asked 2 times for information they already had.For some unknown reason I had to wait another 3 days for it ( plus email them again).It felt like customer service was commenting on queries to look like they were responding when actually they were just asking for information they already had. Either nobody reads complaints or it‚Äôs being auto answered by a service ai bot. Either way it is painful to work through.

"I recently had the misfortune of dealing with Lululemon's customer service, and it was a complete disappointment. For a brand that prides itself on quality and excellence, their customer service fell far short of expectations.I simply wanted to modify the size of an order I had placed a 1.20hr ago, but the representatives I spoke with seemed utterly incompetent. Despite explaining my situation clearly, they offered no viable solutions and seemed unaware of basic customer service protocols. As someone who works in customer care myself, I was shocked by their lack of knowledge and willingness to help.What's even more frustrating is that the issue was entirely their fault to begin with. Due to their system limitations, I was unable to make the modification directly, yet they refused to take responsibility for their own shortcomings.Overall, my experience with Lululemon's customer service was nothing short of a nightmare. It's truly disheartening to see such a renowned brand fail so miserably in an aspect that is crucial for customer satisfaction. I certainly won't be recommending Lululemon to anyone based on this dreadful encounter.","{'neg': 0.213, 'neu': 0.669, 'pos': 0.117, 'compound': -0.9729}",-0.9729,Negative

When I emailed the bottle I was told that I would not be refunded the ¬£10.

"‚ÄúThe online service is absolutely horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible."" - Lululemon Store Leader, Columbus Ohio‚Ä¶one of Lululemon‚Äôs own store leaders said it best!As a long-time admirer of lululemon, it pains me to say that my recent experiences have tarnished my perception of the brand. What was once perceived as a symbol of excellence in quality and customer service now appears to be a facade deteriorating due to disregard and disinterest.Quality issues have become alarmingly prevalent, with representatives admitting to a backlog in addressing customer concerns under their Quality Promise. Waiting up to 15 business days, or perhaps more, for a response hardly reflects a commitment to customer satisfaction. It's disheartening to learn that their quality queue is inundated with cases.Equally disappointing is the apparent reluctance of senior leaders to engage with customer feedback (i.e., respond via phone call, as requested). Despite attempts to communicate concerns, it seems that some voices are actively suppressed. Being apparently blocked via email by senior leaders like Sun Choe, Chief Product Officer, and Nikki Neuburger, Chief Brand Officer, speaks volumes about their receptiveness to constructive feedback and their dedication to customer service.Even attempting to escalate matters through traditional channels proves pointless, as contacting a supervisor or manager via customer service yields the dismissive response, ""we don't do transfers."" Such a stance only reinforces the impression that customer satisfaction is low on their list of priorities.In light of these revelations, I urge others to come forward and share their experiences and feedback, despite Lululemon's apparent attempts to shut out valuable voices.","{'neg': 0.113, 'neu': 0.771, 'pos': 0.116, 'compound': -0.4442}",-0.4442,Negative

Since it wasn't delivered before I left, I would've missed the return date if it didn‚Äôt fit. I was informed that although every online order I've made gives an ""arrives by"" date, that date is actually an estimated delivery date and not a guarantee. The response to my frustration was that shipping is 2-6 business days and they'd pass along my frustrations. Of course, since those emails several weeks ago, it still says ""arrives by"" when ordering. I think the website is incredibly misleading and the customer service was useless and bordering on rude. If the shipping is 2-6 business days, there should be a range of delivery dates with the ""arrives by"" date being the latest of the range.

This was on Friday January 27th- already 9 days since I have placed the order. UPS said that they were missing the number from my street and for this reason they have not made the delivery already. I was shocked because first of all no one from the Lululemon customer service team contacted to ask for my house number so the delivery could be made. Anyways after UPS took my house number they told me that they would be delivering on Monday. I call today and UPS told me that they are cancelling and returning my order and that I should get in touch with the lululemon customer service. What??? No one from their customer service team called me to fix this, I had to chase the order, the order had a fake message for a long time saying that it was on the way to my house and they make the change and say that they will deliver and 2 days later they said that they cancel the order and will be refunding me??? On top of everything I have to now wait to receive the refund and go through the hassle or re ordering again- which I I‚Äôll not as it is clear that this company doesn‚Äôt have a customer service team!!! This entire experience has made me very angry and made me waste a lot of time.","{'neg': 0.115, 'neu': 0.851, 'pos': 0.034, 'compound': -0.9841}",-0.9841,Negative

"Both online and in-store experience were absolutely awful. I've been a loyal customer to Lululemon for years. This year mark the end of it, I can't understand how to still have customer after how they treat them. I've been contacting GEC chat multiple times, seriously got the chat closed to my face AT LEAST 30 times. 1. Ive never been disrespectful and 2. I was not AFK. They politely tell you to f*** off and close the chat without providing any assistance if they don't have an right-away copy/paste sentence to answer your question. GEC resolution team is just as bad as chat service. In 7 emails I have not received any useful feedback or assistance; again they send copy/paste paragraph. In a year i've bought over 10 pairs of leggings, two outdoor jacket, 7 joggers and multiple bras. Not a single item is still in good condition. Jackets are pilling like crazy inside, all my joggers waistband are folded in half and don't hold anything, leggings are all pilling as well, sport bras straps are now loose and i'm 32A, not 36DD. To me this is a MAJOR QUALITY ISSUE. However don't think of reaching out asking for assistance with a quality issue, they will ignore you, don't assist if they do respond and you will waste your time. I also had an employee telling me on the chat (transcription saved for reference) to hire a lawyer to contact Lululemon. In-store experience was just as terrible, i've been told my the sale representative that Lululemon never sold any Align in 28"" and to go shop somewhere else after I politely said I was looking for the lenght 28"" and couldnt find it on their shelves. (I have 4 pairs in Align 28 at home...) I've been waiting for over 6 months for resolution, still none. I never receive the promised gift card Resolution team told me I would receive for all the trouble and bad experience. Last correspondence after months of not receiving a reply was ""Oh we can't locate the mention of gift card."" Do yourself a favor and go shop somewhere else.

When I explained this to the agent, their response was complete disinterest - and arrogantly stated ""well I won't be offering any compensation"". I hadn't even asked for any, and that was their attitude from the onset.Not a single apology, no recognition of the poor experience and certainly no acknowledgement of Lululemon' sizing issues, which clearly is widespread based on online reviews. Have now returned most of the items in question and will not be purchasing from them again. Do not recommend this company to anyone, it doesn't deserve your custom.","{'neg': 0.167, 'neu': 0.778, 'pos': 0.054, 'compound': -0.9648}",-0.9648,Negative
"I have been nothing but disappointing in this company. They are absolutely over priced. I have only owned products from lululemon for a little over a year.

"I have had two seriously terrible experiences with Lululemon, and one lukewarm encounter. Both the terrible experiences concerned quality control issues made worst by terrible customer service. (Terrible 1) Spring 2019, I bought two pairs of Slim Commission pants in 30/34. The two pairs were sized inconsistently. Specifically, one pair was 1.5 inches too wide on the waist. The lack of quality control was actually astounding for pants that are nearly $150/pair. However, the lack of quality customer service was way worse. When I immediately brought it to Lululemon's attention, I was told too bad too sad. I could return for store credit and then wait over a week for a new pair to come in, which I ended up forced into doing. I bit my tongue and justified it because I loved the pants that did fit. (Lukewarm 1) Spring 2020, two of my Commission slims (I was now up to three) had gotten the same hole along stitching near the crotch. I have no idea how these expensive pants could deteriorate so quickly, particularly because I am OCD with these pants. I hardly wear / wash, and when I do wash its: alone / cold / delicate / hand dry. Yet it happened. I am categorizing this one as only lukewarm because I got one of the pairs replaced. However, I need to circle up with the other pair, and I was told by a store rep that they wouldn't help me (Michigan Ave Chicago store). Moreover, these pants shouldn't get holes along stitching like that. Its total BS. Shame on LULU.(Terrible 2) Summer 2020, my replacement pair came in the mail (see Lukewarm 1), and I was horrified to discover another sizing inconsistency problem. This pair was much tighter than my existing pairs. In fact, this pair had a waist two inches smaller than my other pairs and an ankle opening a half inch smaller. What the H**** LULULEMON. Again, I went to the store so I could try on other pairs and a couple sizes to understand what was going on. I walked thirty minutes to a store, and I had to wait in the heat for another thirty minutes to be allowed in due to COVID. When I get in they tell me they have NO 30/34 or 31/34 slim pants. Like not none in the color I wanted; straight-up NONE. How is that even possible. I was annoyed. I explained the quality control issue I had, and got horrible customer service.

"I had heard lots of good things about Lululemon clothing so I was really excited to try out the clothing.  I placed an order with them and quickly received an email from UPS giving me a delivery date.  The parcel did not arrive on that date, or the two subsequent working days.  The tracking information also stopped being updated.  I called UPS to see what was happening.  UPS were very helpful and told me that there was clearly some kind of problem with the package but that I couldn't ask them to do anything about it and I'd have to call Lululemon to get them to raise a claim on the package through their account.  Nice and efficient...I called Lululemon and, after waiting for a patronisingly titled 'Educator' to pick up the phone, the 'Educator' informed me that I would have to wait in AGAIN, wasting more of my time, to see if the package arrived that day. If the package did not arrive, only then would they raise a claim.  The woman I spoke to was really patronising and appeared to not believe me when I told her that UPS had told me that a claim should be raised now because there was clearly a problem with the package.  It was incredibly rude of this 'Educator' to ask that I waste more of my time waiting in for a package that I had been told would not arrive BY THE PARCEL CARRIER THEMSELVES!!!  Unsurprisingly, the package did not arrive that day.  At this point, I just wanted my order cancelled, my money back and to not have to deal with Lululemon's patronising customer service ever again.  So, the next day, I called Lululemon to tell them that the package had not arrived but that I just wanted it recalled and a refund processed.  They told me that I would now have to wait another 4 working days so that UPS could find the package.  Only then could a refund be processed.  I am so, so unhappy with Lululemon's customer service.  As far as I am concerned, the missing package is now an issue between Lululemon and UPS - after all, only Lululemon could raise the claim via their account.  Despite this, Lululemon is now asking me to spend more of my time and effort resolving this issue with UPS by waiting an additional 4 working days. So far, I have wasted 2 days waiting for packages that didn't arrive (1  day of which was completely unnecessary, as I was told by the carrier that the parcel was lost!) and 1 hour of phone calls to UPS and Lululemon discussing the missing package (30 minutes of which was also unnecessary because I had to call Lululemon again to ask them raise a claim AGAIN, in accordance with their request the first time I called them).  Now, I have the joy of looking forward to 4 more working days of waiting for the issue with UPS to be resolved. Lululemon clearly do not value their customers' time or respect them.  The clothing may or may not be great - I'll never get the chance to try it.  I won't be ordering again.Update:  In classic incompetent Lululemon style, I received an email from Lululemon several days later asking me if I had received the parcel (I hadn't). I am not sure why Lululemon did not contact UPS to assess the situation, and instead decided to ask me to do their job for them!  In their email, Lululemon also advised me to call a Canadian number if I hadn't received the parcel.  If they had been competent enough to look at the UK based delivery and billing address, it might have occurred to them to send me a UK number...Anyway, I checked the UPS tracking information (because I had not received any calls, emails or missed delivery notes from UPS) and saw that UPS said the parcel had been delivered to a UPS access point and that I needed to collect it.  This was despite me telling Lululemon several times to return the parcel back to them as soon as it was found by Lululemon.I contacted Live Chat immediately and explained that the parcel should have been returned to Lululemon. The agent was very helpful and quick to respond (hence why I have increased my review from 1 to 2 stars) and issued my refund immediately.","{'neg': 0.073, 'neu': 0.863, 'pos': 0.064, 'compound': -0.8809}",-0.8809,Negative

I will NEVER give a dime to this company again!","{'neg': 0.086, 'neu': 0.886, 'pos': 0.027, 'compound': -0.8858}",-0.8858,Negative
Awful service. I bought a pants here but it got pills right after one time washing. Then the store blamed for the material that have to be pilling. After all they denied to exchange although they said in their commercial ‚Äúour quality promise if our product doesn‚Äôt perform for you we will take it back‚Äù,"{'neg': 0.161, 'neu': 0.791, 'pos': 0.048, 'compound': -0.7935}",-0.7935,Negative
"I was waiting for processing of my return during 2.5 months! One months after sending the item back to Lululemon, I've realised that I didn't receive my money back. I've checked my Lululemon account where I find out that the status field of the return is still ""in progress"". So I've contacted customer service, where they told me that they received my parcel and the refund should be issued in a couple of days. One more month passed and I still didn't get my money, as well as the status was still ""in progress""! Contacted the customer service again, I was told that they ""experienced a small hiccup"". What?!.. May be they think that as this is an expensive brand, their customers don't care about money and can forget about 68 GBP missing in their wallet?! Never in my life the return process took so long! In the end, I was told that my parcel never reached their warehouse but ‚Äúin order to make things right‚Äù they will still be refunding me for the item.Disclaimer: that was my first online order from Lululemon, so I don‚Äôt have any other (positive) experiences.","{'neg': 0.041, 'neu': 0.951, 'pos': 0.008, 'compound': -0.6111}",-0.6111,Negative
"I am utterly fed up of trying to buy Lululemon stock online - and this review should be another reason for LuluLemon to pull their proverbial finger out and fix their website.I kept trying to buy a pair of shorts and a vent tech but the system kept telling me my card didn't have funds - even though it has 30x the amount needed!Anyway, I chatted online to the customer service rep to find out what was going on... she looked into it and found out that one item - the vent tech - was out of stock. I told her it was unacceptable to display items as 'in stock' and then give wrong error codes to customers when they try to check out.I then selected another vent tech for my yoga practice (I'm a teacher) and I got exactly the same error. I then tried to check out the shorts - and all items are, in fact, out of stock.Ugh.Such a terrible online shopping experience, I wonder how on earth LuluLemon actually serve any of their customers online.","{'neg': 0.11, 'neu': 0.89, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.967}",-0.967,Negative
"I'd heard much about the excellent items from lululemon, so I finally made an online purchase from their UK store. I really wanted to try their Wunder Pants and I found a perfect pair in my size. That was enough for me, however I browsed a bit more and, lo' and behold, found a perfect sweater that matched it! Yay! I got super excited, ordered both and received my confirmation email.Two days later, I receive another email saying my order has shipped.Oh, but... One part of my order isn't available anymore. I'm like ""what?"" Oh, it's the pair of pants that's no longer available and actually now I'm just getting the sweater, which I only got because they matched the pants... Obviously I'm disappointed, because I really don't need a sweater just for kicks.So I contact the help desk, explaining the situation. Turns out their warehouse systems were down and actually those pants were out of stock. Fine, these things happen. But I'd still very much like the pants or, alternatively, cancel my order altogether. Turns out cancelling isn't an option, because the sweater is already in transit. And then... the only thing the poor girl could come up with was to give me individual store phone numbers in the UK, which I could then proceed to call myself to find one that had those pants and have them shipped to me.I mean, are you kidding me right now? Not only did I order something that I am not receiving because YOUR systems failed, now you're asking ME to solve YOUR problem?! Horrible customer service, will be returning the sweater as soon as I receive it and will never order again. Bye lululemon. You have been weighed. You have been measured. And you have been found wanting.","{'neg': 0.07, 'neu': 0.843, 'pos': 0.087, 'compound': -0.567}",-0.567,Negative
